      para1: `
        I'm Olivier Gervais-Gougeon, a recent Computer Science graduate from
        the University of Victoria in British-Columbia and a fully bilingual Canadian citizen.
      `,
      para2: `
        I have experience with Software and Game Development thanks to various apps, websites,
        and games I have built, both as personal projects and during my 16 months of co-op work
        as a Full Stack Software Developer and Web Developer.
      `,
      para3: `
        I'm driven by my creativity and desire to make things that spread joy and help people.
        That's why I've always built software with great attention to detail and consideration
        for the end-user experience. It's also why I launched my YouTube channel in 2016
        to share my passion for Nintendo, game design, and the games industry
        with others in my spare time. Since then, I've created over 400+ videos
        and hosted hundreds of community livestreams giving me extensive video production,
        hosting, and graphic design experience.
      `,
      para4: `
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing and learning about the history of video games.
        I'm a big fan of The Legend of Zelda but I play pretty much all genres of games,
        AAA or indie alike. I also play tabletop card games like Magic: The Gathering.
      `,
      para5: `
        Lastly, I love continuously learning about tech and computer hardware.
        I've built a few computers over the years and always find it interesting to try my hand
        at hardware repairs or modding retro game consoles. Aside from that, recently
        I've been trying to learn more about photography.
        I also enjoy sports like tennis, skating, and skiing.
